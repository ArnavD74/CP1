
PMR: 
<+s>: I was able to use a blank space to seperate the different people's contact information.

<+s>: I was also able figure out the syntax based on my errors and did not have to refer to the lesson when having syntax questions.

<-s>: I was not used to the seemingly simple BlueJ editor as I have used different ones in the past, and was initially unsure how to run the code.

The main point of this assignment was to familiarize myself with the BlueJ editor, learn how to use white spaces, indentation, in-line comments, a main() method. 
and conduct a successful PMR.

This relates to a real-life situation because now instead of having to re-iterate information, I can make it display multiple times with ease in a proper presentable format. 

I have learned the basics of Java, such as starting the IDE and writing my first lines of code. 

My biggest problem was running the program but referring to the informational files helped me quickly recover.

In the future, someonething I would do differently is learn how to format text to make it appear better in the console page.
