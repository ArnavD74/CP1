1. My data's formatting could be improved if there was a defined 
table with the values on it, for example, a spreadsheet, instead of 
spacing text from eachother periodically for legibility.

2. I was unsure how to display multiple variables on one line, and figured out I could add blank spaces and use
the plus sign to do this.

3. I am still unsure how to properly display data in a table, since the way I did it was 
just spacing text with manual dividers.
